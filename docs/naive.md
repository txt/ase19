# Is a Technological Approach to Ethics Naive?

This section is a reality check on the central idea of this book:

1. That technology choices have ethical consequences;
2. By controlling those choices, we can control those consequences.

Sadly, it is all too easy to prove the first point since there are
[too many examples of that](overview.md#ethics-is-a-real-problem).

But as to the second point, that is more problematic.  The best
intentions of engineers can be subverted  by random, or even
malevolent  factors.

Need more here. Reality checks. Rome was not built in a day.

## Review1

For  `Num`bers:

- Define mean and standard deviation. 
- What does a large sd mean? 
- What does a small sd mean? 
- Show a list of numbers for which the standard deviation is zero

For `Sym`bols:

-  There are two terms term1,term2 that  are analogous to mean and standard deviation. What are they?
-  Given the set of symbols "aaaabbc", calculate those terms (it is ok to leave the result as fractions).
- Adjust the set of symbols such that term1 changes value. 
- Adjust the set of symbols such that term2 increases or decreases.
- Show a list of symbols for which the "term2" is zero.

For each of _tool_ &isin; (blusterers, classifiers, regressors,  and multi-objective optimizers).

- Define what _tool_ does
- Give a specific example of when you would use _tool_.
- (Here are  two questions you may not be able to answer... yet) 
  - Name a commonly used algorithm for doing _tool_;
  - Very briefly, describe how _tool_ operators.
- Assume data headers can have the special characters;
  - "!" (for "class")
  -  "<" for ("minimize"), 
  - ">" for (maximize), 
  - "$" (for number) 
  - and that anything without any mark is an independent  symbol.
  Assume a data set has five columns with a header `name,age,daysTillDeath, zipCode,income`
  - Write down a header that means we should use _tool_.

- Precision, recall, false alarm, accuracy
- domiantion, pareto frontier, reference frontier
- hypervolume, IGD, GD, spread

- locality
- decision tree
- nearest neighhor

- when is precision not precise? 
- when is accuracy not accurate?

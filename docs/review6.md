# Review 6

Evolution has the following three operators that support optimization. Describe each one. Comment on what happens if each
turns off, or if each runs away out of control:

- Mutation
- Crossover
- Select

Given an expression _y = x<sup>2</sup>  - x_, show  where _y_ will be minimal  (hint: use differentiation or draw the curve).

Here are several reason discussed in lectures why standard numeric methods (such as those discussed above) may not
work for software systems. Explain each one, with examples.

- Symbols. not numbers


The POM3 and XOMO models distinguish between waterfall and agile development processes.

- For waterfall, define requirements, coding, testing. In what order are these stages conducted?
- For agile, define scrum, the scum backlog, and sprints. Hint: see the following diagram:

XOMO:

- According to Norman Fenton, software project descriptors divide into _personnel_ attributes (that discuss who
  is doing the work) and _product_ attributes (that discusses what is being built) and _process_ attributes
  that discuss _how_ the work is being done. Define and describe the following. For each of the following,
  describe and explain what happens if that attribute is doubled or halved. (Hint: consider 
  the above table.)
  - two XOMO personnel attributes
  - two XOMO product attributes
  - two XOMO process attributes
- Define and distinguish between `months` and `effort`. Given `effort`, show how to calculate `months`.
- The cOCOMO
- Here is one

POM3:

- In POM3, what is the "requirements tree"?
  - Why can't develoers see all ther equirements at tstart of agile project

Fall 2019,   
CSC NC State,  
Professor: Tim Menzies <http://menzies.us>


This is a project-based class where students will use Python to build and extend their own AI tools for software engineering. While DevOps strives to "automated everything", automated software engineering strives to "automate automation". 

This subject will explore methods to augment standard software engineering practices with AI methods (data miners,  optimizers, theorem provers) that that peek over over our shoulders to say "try this, and don't bother  that".  

Objectives: by the end of the course, students should be able to

1. Build and maintain complex Python programs.
2. Build and modify and refactor and remix and repurpose AI software (data miners, optimizers, theorem provers) for SE tasks;
3. Discuss issues associated with applying the above to help society, and customers, achieve their goals better, faster, and cheaper.
4. Speak and write on complex technical issue.

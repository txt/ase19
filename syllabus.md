## General description:

Everyone else is studying AI, or applying AI to SE.

- But what about SE for AI? 

AI software is still software. And software needs maintenance, validation, interfacing, usability additions, etc. That is why AI software needs software engineers!

- And not only that, AI software offers special functions that need specialized approaches by software engineers. So what does engineering look like when applied to AI?

Time to find out.  

- Time to learn what happens after DevOps. 
- While DevOps strives to "automate everything," automated software engineering strives to "automate automation." 
- This subject will explore methods to augment standard software engineering practices with AI methods (data miners, optimizers, theorem provers) that peek over our shoulders to say "try this, and don't bother that."  
 

## Objectives


Objectives: by the end of the course, students should be able to
 
1. Build and maintain complex programs.
2. Build and modify and refactor and remix and repurpose AI software (data miners, optimizers, theorem provers) for SE tasks.
3. Discuss issues associated with applying the above to help society, and customers, achieve their goals better, faster, and cheaper.
4. Speak and write on complex technical issue.

## Details

### Group Mailing List

During term time, all communication will be via
the Slack group https://ase19.slack.com.
. Students are strongly encouraged to contribute their questions and answers to that shared resource.
+ Note that, for communication of a more private nature, contact the lecturer on the email shown above.


### Prerequisite

Note that this is a
**programming-intensive** subject. A programming
background is required in a contemporary language
such as Java or C/C++ or Python. Hence, the
prerequisite for this class is some subject with significant
programming component.
Significant software industry
experience may be substituted, at the instructor's
discretion.  Students in this class will work in
Python, but no background knowledge of that language
will be assumed.

### Expected Workload 

This is tools-based subject
and it is required that students learn and use those
tools (Python, repositories, etc).  Students MUST be
prepared to dedicate AT LEAST 5-8 working hours a
week to this class. 
Laboratory instruction is not included
in this subject (but the first three weeks will be
spent on some in-depth programming tutorials). Note
that the workload for masters and Ph.D. students
will be different (see above).

Sometimes, the lecturer/tutor will require you to attend a review session during their consultation  time. There, students may be asked to review
code, concepts, or comment on the structure of the course. Those sessions are mandatory and failure to attend will result in marks being deducted.

### Grading 

The following grade scale will be used: 

+ A+  (97-100), A (93-96), A-(90-92)
+ B+ (87-89), B (83-86), B-(80-82)
+ C+ (77-79), C (73-76), C-(70-72)
+ D+ (67-69), D (63-66), D-(60-62)
+ F (below 60).

791 students must do a project,  in a  group of 1

591 students : you will do your work in a group of 2

- Optionally, with permission of the lecturer, masters students can swap Homeworks 6,7,8,9,10 with the Project.

<table>
<tr><td></td><td>591</td><td>791</td><td>marks</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mid-term (Thursday October 10, 5:30pm)  </td><td>&check;</td><td>&check;</td><td>20</td></tr>
<tr><td>Final (Tuesday Dec 17, 1pm to 3pm)  </td><td>&check;</td><td>&check;</td><td>30</td></tr>
<tr><td>Homeworks 1,2,3,4,5 </td><td>&check;</td><td>&check;</td><td>25</td></tr>

<tr><td> - project presentation (10 mins) </td><td></td><td>&check;</td><td>7</td></tr>
<tr><td> - report (8 pages) </td><td></td><td>&check;</td><td>15</td></tr>
</table>

### Homework

Homeworks will be done in your groups (of size 1,2 for 791,591 respectively). 

Homeworks must be submitted on the due date, otherwise will lose 1 mark late per day.

Until the Nov 15,  homeworks may be resubmitted, after rework, to get obtain higher marks.

Pause.

So, yes, you must submit SOMETHING each week or lose marks. But if you submit and don't get the grade,
you CAN resubmit (at least, till mid-Nov).

### Poster

Solo poster (on current directions in auto SE).

Poster presentations will be scheduled through out the semester.

- Posters are 2 pages pdf in [ACM format](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)
- Topic: Posters will explain some interesting aspect on some paper on some work NOT authored by Menzies.  Something on data mining and/or search-based SE and/or thorem proving **as applied to some SE task**
- To find examples of that work, see papers **after 2012** from top SE-venues
    - [Google scholar, top SE-venues](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_softwaresystems)
    - In particular, ICSE, TSE, JSS, IST, MSR, ESE, ASE,  TOSEM, ICSM (now ICSME)
    - Poster may burrow definitions and graphics from the paper they are reviewing. BUT. Anything the student must be able to explain in further detail anything they put into their poster.
- Presentation (5 mins talk, 5 mins questions)
- No slides. -Instead, place your 2 page paper under the podium camera, then talk to the content.
- **IMPORTANT** 
    - Prior to class, post your paper to [the submit site](http://tiny.cc/fss18give). Otherwise, lose 1 mark.
    - Front page of poster shiuld include your name(s) and full reference to paper.

Examples:

- https://github.com/aayushi-21/fss18/blob/master/fss_poster.pdf
- https://github.com/FahmidMorshed/fss18/blob/master/Poster/CSC791_FSS2018_Poster.pdf

- https://github.com/rshu/CSC791_Poster/blob/master/main.pdf
- And more. See column M of http://tiny.cc/fss18give

### Project 

Big programming task (report to class due  November; written report due Dec 9 but feel free to submit early) on automated SE. 

Topic: SE and (Data mining and/or optimization and/or theorem proving).

- For project ideas, see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.01550.pdf

Project presentations are report will be due between Nov 15 and Dec 6.

- Project must present two implementations
    - An initial implementation which you will critize using our [baseline criteria](lectures/baseline.md)
    - A second implementation  where the you strive to improve that implementation, according to any of the baseline criteria.
           - Note that merely doing some existing standard data mining project **will NOT** be sufficcient
- Paper are 8+ pages pdf in [ACM format](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)
- The code review will be the lecturer reading the code checking that the implementation is above a minimum level of effort.
     - Lecturer may call students/ teams at any time to his office for such reviews.
- Presentations will start mid-November
- Paper is not due till Dec 9.

Examples:

- See column F of http://tiny.cc/fss18give
- Also, for a project report that went on to be a conference paper, see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05319.pdf

### Attendance

Attendance is extremely important for your learning
experience in this class. Once you reach three
unexcused absences, each additional absence will
reduce your attendance grade by 10%.

Except for officially allowed reasons, your presence in the class if required from day one. 
Late-comers will have to work in their own solo groups (to avoid disruptions to existing groups).

Note that absences for weddings (your own, or someone else's, is not an officially allowed reason).

Exceptions: this subject  will support students who are absent for any of the following
officially allowed reasons:

- Anticipated Absences (cleared with the instructor before the absence).
Examples of anticipated situations include
    - representing an official university function, e.g., participating in a professional meeting, as part of a judging team, or athletic team;
    - required court attendance as certified by the Clerk of Court;
    - religious observances as verified by the Division of Academic and Student Affairs (DASA).
    - Required military duty as certified by the student's commanding officer.
- Unanticipated Absences.  Excuses must be reported to the instructor not more than one week after the return to class.  Examples of unanticipated absences are:
      -  Short-term illness or injury affecting the ability to attend or to be productive academically while in class, or that could jeopardize the health of the individual or the health of the classmates attending.  Students must notify instructors prior to the class absence, if possible, that they are temporarily unable to attend class or complete assignments on time.
      -  Death or serious illnesses in the family when documented appropriately.  An attempt to verify deaths or serious illness will be made by the Division of Academic and Student Affairs.

That support will include changing the schedule of deliverables and/or (in extreme
case) different grading arrangements.


### Academic Integrity

Cheating will be punished to the full extent permitted. Cheating
includes plagiarism of other people's work. All students will be working
on public code repositories and **informed reuse** is encouraged where
someone else's product is:

+ Imported and clearly acknowledged (as to where it came from);
+ The imported project is understood, and
+ The imported project is significantly extended.

Students are encouraged to read each others code and report **uninformed reuse**
to the lecturer. The issue will be explored and, if uncovered,
cheating will be reported to the university
and marks will be deducted if the person who is doing the reuse:

+ Does not acknowledge the source of the product;
+ Does not exhibit comprehension of the product when asked about it;
+ Does not significantly extend the product.

All students are expected to maintain traditional
standards of academic integrity by giving proper
credit for all work.  All suspected cases of
academic dishonesty will be aggressively pursued.
You should be aware of the University policy on
academic integrity found in the Code of Student
Conduct.
 
The  exams will be done individually.  Academic integrity is important.  Do not work together on the exams: cheating on either will be punished to the full extent permitted.  

### Disabilities

Reasonable accommodations will be made for students
with verifiable disabilities. In order to take
advantage of available accommodations, students must
register with Disability Services for Students at
1900 Student Health Center, Campus Box 7509,
919-515-7653. For more information on NC State's
policy on working with students with disabilities,
